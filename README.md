# Home Sales Challenge

I had issues starting my spark session, so I had to edit the spark session start code accordingly. Using spark & average price query, I answered several questions. Then I determined the runtime to answer the questions. Following this, I cached the temporary table and ran anotehr query. Then I had to partition the data by date built as resulting in a new partioneddata folder. After partioning the data, I uncached the temporary table.
